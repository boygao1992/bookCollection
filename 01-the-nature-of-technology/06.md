# Chapter 6: The Origin of Technologies

## 6.0

> Darwin's solution does not work for technology.
> "Add successively as many mail coaches as you please, you will never get a railway thereby" said Schumpeter.
> That does not rule out combination, but it means it must take place in some more **ordered** way than pure randomness.

> We know, mostly from research in sociology, that
>   novel technologies are shaped by social needs
>   ; they come often from experience gained outside the standard domain they apply to
>   ; they originate more often in conditions that support risk
>   ; they originate better with the exchange of knowledge
>   ; they are catalyzed often by networks of colleagues.
> No doubt these findings are true. But
>   they do not explain how a new technology comes into being
>   any more than pointing to suitable soil explains how a seed comes to germinate.

> The mechanism of how novel technologies arise is not Darwinian
> ; novel species in technology do not arise from the accumulation of small changes.
> They arise from a process, a human and often lengthy one, of linking a need with a principle that will satisfy it.
> This linkage stretches from the need itself to the base phenomenon that will be harnessed to meet it, through supporting solutions and subsolutions.
> And making it a recursive process.
> The process repeats until each subproblem resolves itself into one that can be physically dealt with.
> In the end, the problem must be solved with pieces/components that already exist or ones that can be created from ones that already exist.
> To invent something is to find it in what previously exists.

## 6.1 What Qualifies as a Noval Technology?

## 6.2 Finding a Base Principle

> Typically such a need sits for some time with at least some practitioners aware of it, but with none seeing an evident solution.
> Those that do take up the challenges may encounter the situation as a need to be fulfilled or a limitation to be overcome, but they quickly reduce it to a set of requirements
> : a technical problem to be solved.

> example: invention of jet engine for high attitude with low air pressure where piston engines have trouble drawing sufficient oxygen

> The problem now comes forward as it were, looking to meet an appropriate solution.
> The mind becomes fixed on the problem. It scans possibilities that might with further development satisfy the desiderata. This search is conceptual, wide, and often obsessive.
> Newton commented famously that he had come upon his theory of gravitational obits "by thinking on it continuously."
> This continuous thinking allows the subconscious to work, possibly to recall an effect or concept from past experience, and it provides a subconscious alertness so that when a candidate principle or a different way to define the problem suggests itself the whisper at the door is heard.

> Sometimes the principle, the conceptual solution, is stitched together from existing functionalities, each one solving a subproblem.

> example: Ernest Lawrence's invention of cyclotron
> It was arrived at by transforming the problem from that of achieving extremely high voltages, by Wideroe's subprinciple of using low alternating voltage across a series of tubes, then by Lawrence's subprinciple of using a magnetic field to greatly reduce the space needed.


## 6.3 Embodying the Concept in Physical Form

## 6.4 Invention Proceeding from a Phenomenon

## 6.5 What Lies at the Heart of Invention?

## 6.6 The Pyramid of Causality

## 6.7 Invention in Science and Mathematics

> example: Darwin's theory of evolution

> In my language, Darwin did not receive a theory from Malthus.
>   He borrowed a subprinciple: that ongoing competition for scarce resources “selects” the best adapted individuals in a population.
>   And he used this to make workable one of his two main principles, that favorable adaptations would be selected for and could cumulate to produce a new species.
>   The other main principle, that variation generated a range of traits upon which selection could work, he could not reduce to finer explanatory components and had to treat as a postulate.
> But we can certainly say that in putting the parts together as explanatory functionalities, he had got a theory upon which to work.

> Arriving at his base principles took him about fifteen months of hard thinking.
> The rest, the detailed translation of his base principles into a full theory with all the supporting pieces and parts connected to his satisfaction, took him another twenty years.

> Think of a theorem as a carefully constructed logical argument.
> It is valid if it can be constructed under accepted logical rules from other valid components of mathematics
> : other theorems, definitions, and lemmas that form the available parts and assemblies in mathematics.
> Typically the mathematician "sees" or struggles to see one or two overarching principles: conceptual ideas that if provable provide the overall route to a solution.

> All three are constructed from forms or principles
>   : in the case of technology, conceptual methods
>   ; in the case of science, explanatory structures
>   ; in the case of mathematics, truth structures consistent with basic axioms.
> Technology, scientific explanation, and mathematics therefore come into being via similar types of heuristic process
> : fundamentally a linking between a problem and the forms that will satisfy it.

## 6.8 Invention and Novel Building Blocks

> All inventions share the same mechanism
>   : all link a purpose with a principle that will fulfill it
>   , and must translate that principle into working parts.

> Novel building blocks arise in three possible ways
>   : as solutions to standard engineering problems
>     - the Armstrong oscillator
>   ; as non-deliberate inventions
>     - the monetary system
>   ; as inventions proper, radically novel solutions that use new principles
>     - the jet engine
