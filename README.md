> Recently, claims have been made that deep learning is capable of solving AI by Google (DeepMind). Likewise, Facebook AI Research (FAIR) and other companies are actively working in the same direction. However, the question is where does this work stand with respect to cognitive architectures? Overall, the DeepMind research addresses a number of important issues in AI, such as natural language understanding, perceptual processing, general learning, and strategies for evaluating artificial intelligence. Although particular models already demonstrate cognitive abilities in limited domains, at this point they do not represent a unified model of intelligence.

> According to Francis Crick, neuroscience was a lot of data without a theory. His exact words were, “what is conspicuously lacking is a broad framework of ideas.”

chapter 2 neural networks

> My first criterion was the inclusion of time in brain function.
> The second criterion was the importance of feedback.
> The third criterion was that any theory or model of the brain should account for the physical architecture of the brain.

changes
- first-order: Group Theory
- second-order: Type Theory

> Myriads of things can be expressed in a language, except statements referring to that language itself.
> If we want to talk about a language, as linguists and semanticists have to, we need a metalanguage which, in turn, requires a metametalanguage for the expression of its own structure.
> Very much the same holds for the relation between signs and their meaning.

> To confuse method with methodology would produce philosophical nonsense since, as Wittgenstein once said, “philosophical problems arise when language goes on holiday”.
> Unfortunately, natural language often makes a clear distinction between member and class difficult.

> But the formulation that is perhaps most relevant to our subject matter is the one given by Ashby for the cybernetic properties of a machine with input: “It will be seen that the word ‘change’ if applied to such a machine can refer to two very different things.
> There is the change from state to state, . . . , which is the machine’s behavior
> , and there is the change from transformation to transformation, . . . , which is a change of its way of behaving, and which occurs at the whim of the experimenter or some outside factor.
> The distinction is fundamental and must on no account be slighted”.

> Group Theory gives us a framework for thinking about the kind of change that can occur within a system that itself stays invariant
> ; the Theory of Logical Types is not concerned with what goes on inside a class, i.e., between its members, but gives us a frame for considering the relationship between member and class and the peculiar metamorphosis which is in the nature of shifts from one logical level to the next higher.
> If we accept this basic distinction between the two theories, it follows that there are two different types of change
> : one that occurs within a given system which itself remains unchanged
> , and one whose occurrence changes the system itself.

> The old teleology has gone to the devil, but it is now firmly established that matter in its eternal cycle moves according to laws which at a definite stage – now here, now there – necessarily give rise to the thinking mind in organic beings.

> The normal existence of animals is given by the contemporary conditions in which they live and to which they adapt themselves – those of man, as soon as he differentiates himself from the animal in the narrower sense, have as yet never been present, and are only to be elaborated by the ensuing historical development. Man is the sole animal capable of working his way out of the merely animal state – his normal state is one appropriate to his consciousness, one that has to be created by himself.
